# Total War Troy Mod: Temples list

This mod adds a new UI panel to the campaign to list all owned capitals, similar to the provinces list, sorted by the temples you have built. It is useful to manage your gods favor and quickly know where you have built what.

A new button is created near the bottom right radar that lets you open / close this temples list panel.

You can then click on one of the province listed there to select the capital settlement and scroll the camera to its position. Provinces for each god can be sorted by name or temple building level.

The UI is rebuilt anytime a religion building is built or demolished, or when a settlement is acquired or lost.

This mod is active for all factions except Penthesilea, mostly because I don't know how to get the list of buildings for horde factions as they don't own any regions.

This is a just a script mode, so it should be compatible with everything and should be save compatible.

## Install

Download the mod .pack file, and put it into Troy's data folder ( "...Epic Games\TotalWarSagaTROY\data") and it will activate automatically. If you want to deactivate it you will need to move it out of the folder.

Remember to remove the mod when official Troy modding support hits, as you will most likely manage mods through the game launcher.
